        It was the summer of 2003, and like many teenagers of this generation, a lot of people found themselves with a Nokia 3310 in hand, discovering the mesmerizing world of the Java game "Snake." The simplicity of its design was a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos of the modern gaming landscape. Despite its minimalistic graphics and straightforward premise, "Snake" quickly became an obsession. Each movement of the pixelated snake on the tiny screen felt like a thrilling dance with fate, and every apple consumed was a step closer to mastering the game.

        I remember the first time I played "Snake" vividly. It was during my early years in elementary school where I finished my homework early, as the genius I was. I was bored and looked over to see what the other kids were playing on their chromebooks, and I asked one of them, "what website is that?". He responded and I instantly type the url in the search bar. As soon as I loaded up the website, "Snake" was one of the games was on there. I clicked on it and enjoyed my time, and even my friends played it!

        As the years passed, "Snake" became more than just a way to pass time. Google, and other organizations, were editing the game to make it more fun. They added colors to the snake, multiple gamemodes, and much more! Each section was a blend of anticipation and strategy, a test of my patience and precision. My friends and I would compare high scores, the numbers serving as silent badges of honor. The game had a unique way of bringing us together, sparking conversations and friendly rivalries. It was a testament to how a simple game could create shared experiences and forge connections.

        Years later, as technology advanced and smartphones became ubiquitous, I found myself reminiscing about those simpler times. Despite the array of sophisticated games available at my fingertips, I often returned to "Snake," now available as an app, for a taste of nostalgia. The game still held the same charm and challenge, friendly competitions, and the joy of mastering a deceptively simple game. "Snake" was not just a game; it was a part of my adolescence, a symbol of an era where fun was found in simplicity, and every apple consumed was a victory worth celebrating.
